\b{Comm}

This program or family programs features digital creatures communicating only indirectly through their shared world of bits (blocks and spaces). Each \q{ghost} or \q{ant} is initialized with a fixed response to its neighborhood, as well as whether or not it leaves a $1$ or a $0$ (a block or a space) in its wake. These creatures are completely invisible to one another, and they can even be in the same spot at the same time. The program will just display the single creature on top of the stack (which happens to be the one created last, with a higher index in the array.) 

At the moment, there is only a C version. The \q{graphics} are just unicode blocks and spaces in the console.
